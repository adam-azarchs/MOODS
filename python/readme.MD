Installing from PyPi
--------------------

The easiest way to install MOODS is using pip:

(a) Install the module to your local Python library path:

    pip install --user moods-python

(b) Install the module for all users:

    pip install moods-python

Installing the MOODS package from PyPi installs the `moods-dna` command to you
Python path. Test it by running:

    moods-dna --help


Installing from Source
----------------------

Alternatively, you can install MOODS from the source package:

(a) Compile the extensions in place and create a symlink under `scripts/`
(if you just want to test things without installing to Python library path,
or you are simply planning to use the `moods_dna.py` scripts for basic 
analysis):

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    cd scripts
    ln -s ../MOODS/    

(b) Install the module to your local Python library path:

    python setup.py install --user

(c) Install the module for all users:

    sudo python setup.py install

You can test MOODS by running the `moods_dna.py` script with
the example data provided with the package:

    cd scripts/
    python moods_dna.py -m example-data/matrices/*.{pfm,adm} -s example-data/seq/chr1-5k-55k.fa -p 0.0001
    python moods_dna.py --help
